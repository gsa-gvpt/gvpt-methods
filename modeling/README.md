## Video

A video of the presentation can be found [here](https://umd.box.com/s/dpsw7hp8t35v4futbqgi8514gt2js9dw).

## Description

The first part of the workshop uses simple simulated data to highlight practical trade-offs between modeling and matching. Xiaonan introduces matching as nonparametric data preprocessing with the R package `MatchIt`.

In the second part of the workshop, he introduces the R packages `modelr`, `broom`, and `purrr` that can seamlessly integrate modeling into a pipeline of data manipulation and visualisation.
