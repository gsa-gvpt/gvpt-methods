## Description

The amount of replicable studies in quantitative social science is surprisingly low given the increased number of published articles across disciplines. One reason for the lack of replicable studies is a human problem, as research requires keeping track of data across transformations and multiple methods of analysis. Keeping track requires developing a structure for maintaining and transforming your data. In this workshop, I introduce the concept of creating a research workflow that follows agreed-upon standards for ease of replication. This workflow, demonstrated in RStudio, is based on the Teaching Integrity in [Empirical Research (TIER) protocol](https://www.projecttier.org/about/).
In practice, I will show the folder structure of a replicable project, introduce the use of RStudio snippets for making code templates, and share an easy set of functions to jump-start your project's organization, the moment you get a great new research idea.
