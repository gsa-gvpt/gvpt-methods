## Description

Building a dataset from scratch, particularly one that converts qualitative information into quantitative data, is part and parcel of the research track. In graduate school, research assistants are often tasked with spearheading data collection efforts under the supervision of a faculty member. These can be important opportunities for professional growth but are also rife with challenges, from making important coding decisions and managing other research assistants, to adjusting coding methods and communicating realistic timelines to supervisors. In this workshop, I review common challenges related to dataset building (learned the hard way) and offer preventative solutions to improve data collection at each step of the way: preparation, coding, and cleaning data.
