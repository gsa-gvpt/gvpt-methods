## Description

This presentation introduces some of the essential Tidyverse packages and provides an overview of their use cases for data cleaning, including data ingestion, joining tibbles, string cleaning, and handling missing data (NAs). 

- The R script from the presentation can be accessed [here](https://github.com/gsa-gvpt/gvpt-methods/blob/master/datacleaning/gsa_datacleaning.R) and the data is available [here](https://umd.box.com/s/knmvsg3u8ocpyov1zrfjara9dmvlwpia).

## Link to Cheatsheets

In the presentation, Ted mentions the so-called 'cheat sheets' one can reference when first learning a package. There are a number for these for different R packages, not just the Tidyverse. The [cheatsheets](https://github.com/gsa-gvpt/gvpt-methods/tree/master/datacleaning/cheatsheets) suddirectory of this repo contains all the cheat sheets available on Rstudio's website as of 11-01-2020. Some cheat sheets are translated into multiple languages and are included as well.
