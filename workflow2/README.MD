## Description

Building on Henry's Introduction to Research Workflows Part I, I will step you through developing robust code to support your next fully-replicable journal article. By the end of the workshop, I will introduce to you techniques for sourcing data from the web; version controlling your data, analysis, and documents with Git and Github; common data cleaning and calculation hacks to speed up and streamline your analysis; embedding your code directly into your write-up using RMarkdown, and customizing your graphics and data visualizations. I will do this by stepping through the entire workflow: from data sourcing to cleaning to write-up. This workshop emphasizes techniques that make your analysis robust and that promote collaboration between co-authors and other political science scholars looking to build on your work.
