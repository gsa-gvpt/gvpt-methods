## Description

This is an introduction to machine learning, specifically classification and prediction tasks, with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

The workshop itself has three parts. First, we will unravel the basic terms and concepts of machine learning. Second, we will explore the KNN algorithm, a straightforward yet effective model perfect for those just starting out. It's suitable for both classification and prediction tasks. Last, there will be a hands-on demonstration of using KNN for classification tasks using a simulated two-class dataset.

No prior knowledge or prerequisites are required. This workshop is crafted especially for beginners, ensuring each step is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
