## Description

In this workshop, Chase discusses regression discontinuity designs (RDD) using observational data. He highlights various types of RDD, its appropriate uses, and potential pitfalls. He also examines a recent piece of literature and some sample code. The workshop consists of the following parts:

1) An overview of the RDD method
2) A discussion of the most appropriate scenarios for RDD deployment
3) Potential concerns with the RDD method
4) Examination of a recent UMD-published article using RDD
5) Example code solutions
6) Resources for further learning
