## Description

This is a hands-on, model-based workshop on data visualization in R. The main goal of the workshop is to teach you how to go from models (and data) into nice, informative graphs. We will be using ggplot2 as our visualization library, and some other packages from the tidyverse family to model and extract results. Although the workshops covers some basics of data visualization using ggplot, I hope to spend more time showing how to prepare your data, and how to extract information from statistical models in a way that you can easily input into a ggplot graph.

## Materials

Tiago was industrious enough to create a [website](http://datavizgvpt.tiagoventura.rbind.io/) for the workshop that is a one-stop shop for the presentation, materials, and references.
