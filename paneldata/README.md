## Description

In this workshop, we discuss both classic and recent literature on causal inference using panel data, with difference-in-differences as a special case. We highlight the potential outcomes approach to panel data, its core assumptions, challenges, and practical solutions. The workshop mainly consists the following parts:

1) A brief review of the potential outcome framework
2) Show different structures of panel data (e.g. difference-in-differences, staggered adoption, treatment reversal, etc.) with panel data visualization tools
3) Introduce key causal assumptions and inferences under the canonical difference-in-differences design
4) Review two-way fixed effects (2FE) linear regression, a popular approach used in general panel data settings with multiple units, multiple periods and varying structures of treatment adoptions
5) Introduce the conditions under which causal inference using 2FE model is problematic
6) Introduce relatively easy-to-apply methods that can improve two-way fixed effects model

## Statistical software for Difference-in-Differences and Two-Way fixed effects regression

Please note that the below packages have been recently developed, and will be updated frequently. We suggest you carefully read each "vignette" and (optionally) "paper" before you use them for your own research. We marked the ones that we think are relatively easier to use with ":exclamation:".

To install each R package, please visit each of their "vignette" page. To install and run STATA commands, visit [this webpage](https://www.stata.com/support/ssc-installation/).
