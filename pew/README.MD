## Summary/Abstract

Pew Research Center traditionally specializes in survey research, but since 2015, Data Labs—a group of data scientists, engineers, and computational social scientists—has been working to expand and supplement Pew’s survey research with computational methods and digital data sources. The Data Labs team conducts original substantive research on social science topics of public interest by exploring new data sources and applying computational methods such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. Our research has ranged from collecting and analyzing the social media activity of both political elites and the American public to scraping, transcribing, and analyzing sermons posted online, to investigating algorithmic bias in search engine results. In addition to our applied computational research, Data Labs also works to develop and promote emerging computational methods for academic and industry practitioners as well as to make them accessible to broad audiences.
