## Description

In this workshop, we provide a practical introduction to experimental research designs. We introduce the logic of how experiments work in establishing causality, highlight various types of experiments, explain how to analyze experimental effects, and briefly cover select advanced issues including performing randomization checks, manipulation checks, and using covariates. In the second half of the workshop we cover the practical steps needed to carry out an experiment including gaining IRB approval, pre-registration, conducting power analyses,  using the GVPT experimental lab, the trade-offs between various survey firms, and funding sources for graduate students. The workshop consists of the following parts:

1. The Logic of Experiments
2. Types of Experiments
3. Analyzing Effects
4. Performing Randomization checks
5. Select Advanced Issues: using covariates (CATEs); block randomization.
6. Practical Steps
    1. IRB
    2. Pre-registration
    3. Power-analyses
    4. GVPT Experimental Lab
    5. Survey Firms
    6. Other Fielding Options
    7. Funding Sources
