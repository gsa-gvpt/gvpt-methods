## Description

We introduce the concept of geographic data, discuss its uses and offer an example of its use in a recent political science paper published in APSR. We then discuss the promises and potential for GIS data, particularly for use by graduate students thanks to the proliferation of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI).
